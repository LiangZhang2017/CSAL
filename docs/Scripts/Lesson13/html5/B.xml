    <say>I think it is B, you need to introduce the major event.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B38" name="B38">
    <say>I think it is C, you need to talk about the ending.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B39" name="B39">

  <message id="B41" name="B41">
    <say>I'm going to go for B. I think the setting needs to be introduced in the beginning of the story.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B42" name="B42">
    <say>I'm going to go for A. I think It's the ending with the problem solved.</say>

  </message>
  <message id="B47" name="B47">

    <say>Always remember the flow chart we saw in the beginning of the lesson when defining unknown words.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A59" name="A59">
    <say>by going through all of the words that Jordan does not know we are all gaining a better understanding for the article and the topic of the article.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A60" name="A60">
    <say>I love how helpful you are with defining the words for Jordan</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A61" name="A61">
    <say>Great! Let's keep going then!</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A62" name="A62">
    <say>Yes Jordan! Take a look at this chart that describes steps to defining words you don't know.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A63" name="A63">
    <say>Step 1 shows us that we have to find context clues. You do this by looking for words or phrases in the surrounding sentences in a passage. You can find words that have similar or different meanings that will help you figure out the definition of the word you don't know. </say>
  </message>
  <message id="A64" name="A64">
    <say>In this activity if you are struggling with finding context clues, I will help you by flashing certain context clues in the passage to help you figure out the definition. </say>
  </message>
  <message id="A65" name="A65">
    <say>Yes Jordan! Like an 18 wheeler! 18 wheelers are distinctive because they are larger and easier to see!</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A66" name="A66">
    <say>Which word do you have highlighted next?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A67" name="A67">
    <say>I love how you are helping Jordan</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A68" name="A68">
    <say>! This way both of you have practice with defining words you may not know.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A69" name="A69">
    <say>Hi</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A70" name="A70">
    <say>and Jordan! How are you two today!?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A71" name="A71">
    <say>We will help you Jordan! Today we can try defining words by looking at context clues in the text.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A72" name="A72">
    <say>you are doing a great job helping Jordan define words!</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A73" name="A73">
    <say>I'm so happy that you are helping Jordan define new words</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A74" name="A74">
    <say>. Let's keep going I know Jordan has more words that he'd like defined.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A75" name="A75">
    <say>Jordan is the flow chart beginning to make sense?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A76" name="A76">
    <say>Jordan what is the next word you needed help with?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A77" name="A77">
    <say>Next you have to create your own definition for the word based on the context clues. This definition can be as short or as long as you'd like... just as long as it helps you define the word you don't know.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A78" name="A78">
    <say>Let's see it Jordan!</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A79" name="A79">
    <say>when helping Jordan define the words he does not know, Keep in mind our flow chart with the 4 steps, finding context clues, creating a definition, replacing the word with our definition, and seeing if our definition makes sense in the sentence... Go ahead and read the article and click to continue when you are finished.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A80" name="A80">
    <say>The word untidy means that something is messy Jordan.</say>

  <message id="A81" name="A81">
    <say>Let's stay on track Jordan! Let's see another word you are having trouble defining.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A82" name="A82">
    <say>Jordan let's see your second article!</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A83" name="A83">
    <say>you will be doing the same thing you did in the last article. Remember to use context clues to help you define the words Jordan highlights.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A84" name="A84">
    <say>The article will be able to explain this better than I can Jordan,  but black Holes are stars that have exploded. Once this happens their gravity is so strong that they suck up everything that is near them!</say>

  <message id="A85" name="A85">
    <say>I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson with me!</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A86" name="A86">
    <say>You guys did great! To recap, let's look at the flow chart. first we find context clues,next we create our own definition,from there we replace our definition in the sentence to see if it makes sense, then if it does make sense, we got the definition! If not, we have to start over at step 1. </say>
  </message>
  <message id="A87" name="A87">
    <say>Always try to think about these steps when you two are facing a tough word that has to be defined.</say>

    <say>Good bye have a great day!</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A89" name="A89">

  </message>
  <message id="A90" name="A90">
    <say>You're welcome Jordan! so, you said you had one final word highlighted?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A91" name="A91">
    <say>Now, in step 3 you replace the word you don't know with the definition you created in step 2. </say>
  </message>
  <message id="A92" name="A92">
    <say>Finally! In step 4, You ask yourself, does my definition of the word make sense in the sentence? If it does then you got it! You just defined a word you didn't know! But! If it doesn't, then go back to step one until your definition fits the sentence</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A93" name="A93">
    <say>Great!</say>

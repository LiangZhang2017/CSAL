  </message>
  <message id="A151" name="A151">
    <say>It can be, Jordan. Take a look at the apples and oranges here to give you a sense of what it means to read a compare and contrast. In this text structure, we are looking to find what the writer thinks are similarities and differences between two or more things.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A152" name="A152">
    <say>That's a good comparison! Here is another way of thinking about it. The diagram below is called a Venn diagram and it helps us to look at a comparison between two things.</say>

  <message id="A153" name="A153">
    <say>Right, so we can see that Washington was born in Virginia and Lincoln was born in Kentucky. However, they are both U.S. Presidents!</say>

  <message id="A154" name="A154">
    <say>Great, Jordan! Let's start this activity by reading a passage about Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. We will answer some questions that compare and contrast their careers.</say>

    <say>Jordan, I bet you will love today's reading!</say>

    <say>Indeed! So that was one difference between Kobe and Jordan. What is another one?</say>

  <message id="A158" name="A158">
    <say>Jordan, doing exercise is good, but now we need to focus. We will have to just read about exercise for now.</say>

    <say>Glad to hear that, Jordan!</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A160" name="A160">

    <say>Right, Jordan. But one important difference shouldn't be ignored. Let's see whether</say>

  </message>
  <message id="A28" name="A28">
    <say>The Williford bank ad was persuasive. The bank is trying to convince Jordan that he should cash his check there. The bank uses opinions to convince. Remember that opinions are not facts, they can be argued against.</say>

    <say>and I are here to help you. I found three different articles about cashing checks and paying bills that may help!</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A35" name="A35">
    <say>I found a persuasive article, an informational article, and a narrative article.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A36" name="A36">
    <say>Persuasive articles use opinions  to try and convince the reader of some point of view. An informational article contains many facts and is meant to inform the reader. A narrative text tells a story and entertains us by affecting our emotions.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A37" name="A37">
    <say>You got it! Let's take a look at the first article</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A38" name="A38">

  </message>
  <message id="A39" name="A39">
    <say>, based on what we read, do you think this article is informational,  persuasive, or narrative?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A40" name="A40">
    <say>This is an informational text because the writer uses facts to inform us about how to cash a check.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A41" name="A41">
    <say>Remember that facts, opinions, and emotion triggers inform us about the type of text. So does this text have a lot of facts, opinions or emotion triggers</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A42" name="A42">
    <say>? Think about it and then try a different answer choice.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A43" name="A43">
    <say>This is an informational text because the writer uses facts to to inform us about how to cash a check.</say>
  </message>

    <say>So</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A46" name="A46">
    <say>, what could happen to you or Jordan if you accept a check from someone you don't know?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A47" name="A47">
    <say>If Jordan accepts a check from someone he doesn't know the check could bounce.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A48" name="A48">
    <say>in the first section it says you should trust the person who wrote the check. What else does it say can happen if you don't trust the check writer?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A49" name="A49">
    <say>If you accept a check from a person who is not trustworthy, the check could bounce. Make sure you trust the person who writes you a check.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A50" name="A50">
    <say>Jordan which answer did you select?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A51" name="A51">
    <say>The bank has to verify that Jordans ID matches the name on the check before they can cash it! You have selected the correct answer.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A52" name="A52">
    <say>if Jordan doesn't have his ID he can't cash his check, but why? Why does he need to have his ID when  he goes to cash his check</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A53" name="A53">
    <say>Jordan has to bring his ID to the bank to prove to them he is who he says he is. The bank has to verify Jordan's identity before they can cash his check! </say>
  </message>
  <message id="A54" name="A54">

    <say>, I have highlighted this sentence in the article for you! Does this sentence contain an opinion, a fact, or an emotion trigger?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A56" name="A56">
    <say>A fact states something that cannot be denied. In this case the fact is, to endorse a check you always have to flip it over and sign next to the x. Great job recognizing this is a fact</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A57" name="A57">

  </message>
  <message id="A72" name="A72">
    <say>What do you think the answer is Jordan?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A73" name="A73">
    <say>Some people will think the opinion that they have the most helpful bank tellers is true, while others might not agree. An opinion is not a fact, which means it has not been proven. You picked the correct answer.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A74" name="A74">
    <say>remember that an opinion is different from a fact because a fact is proven information. So how can we know that Williford banks claim is an opinion?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="A75" name="A75">
    <say>An opinion is something that can be argued. Some people will think it is true while others will think it is not true. Also, an opinion is not a fact, which means it has not shown to be true.</say>

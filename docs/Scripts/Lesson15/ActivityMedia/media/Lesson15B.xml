        <say>Cristina, I noticed that the princess at the end did not tell the Evening Star to shine over her life, but over her good fortunes.</say>

        <say>Ah I get it. Because fairy tales usually involve magic, which does not follow the law of nature.</say>

      <message id="B51" name="B51">
        <say>So describing the evening star as being "dead" isn't really that he is dead? Since technically the evening star really lives forever. I'm kind of confused here.</say>
      </message>
      <message id="B52" name="B52">

        <say>I like how the prince is giving Turandot a taste of her own medicine. He really is smart.</say>

        <say>Yes but now she's torturing an innocent person for it, I really don't like her.</say>

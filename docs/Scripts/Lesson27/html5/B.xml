    <say>Hey</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B3" name="B3">
    <say>and Cristina. I'm looking forward to this lesson.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B4" name="B4">
    <say>Great, this always helps me understand what to do during a lesson.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B5" name="B5">
    <say>I see, anything else Cristina?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B6" name="B6">
    <say>Ok great! Let's get started then</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B7" name="B7">
    <say> I thought the answer was, the writer knows a lot about computers.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B8" name="B8">
    <say>I thought the answer was, I did everything I could to get money. Because If  the writer went back to school, he or she could make more money.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B9" name="B9">
    <say>That's what I thought too. If the writer didn't pay much attention to computers, then he or she probably didn't learn anything about them. </say>
  </message>
  <message id="B10" name="B10">
    <say>Thanks Cristina. I'm on a role!</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B11" name="B11">
    <say>I thought the answer was the writer went to college and did not study.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B12" name="B12">
    <say>Oh that makes sense, I didn't think about it that way,</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B13" name="B13">
    <say>See you later!</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B14" name="B14">
    <say>The writer also said that he or she didn't complete high school, so couldn't the first choice be the right answer too?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B15" name="B15">
    <say>Okay, so just because the writer says something does not mean it is the main idea?</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B16" name="B16">
    <say>I was not sure about this one. That involved a lot of thinking. This is a tough lesson.</say>
  </message>
  <message id="B17" name="B17">
    <say>I sure hope so!</say>

				<div id="para1" class="para">
				<span class="indent"></span>Working for the government used to be a good career choice. It meant a steady paycheck. It came with good benefits, such as health care and retirement pay. Hard workers could expect raises and promotions. It was easy to get better jobs and make more money. People felt pride in serving the country. 
				</div>
				
				<div id="para2" class="para">
				<span class="indent"></span>But these days, federal workers are frustrated and worried. Politics has gotten in the way of their jobs and quality of life. Harmful budget cuts really hit workers hard. Democrats and Republicans could not agree on how to reduce the nation's deficit. The United States owes some $680 billion. So they passed a harsh law that would cut spending across the government if they could not choose the cuts together. 
				</div>
				
				<div id="para3" class="para">
				<span class="indent"></span>Neither side wanted the law to take effect. They used it to try to force an agreement. But they never could agree. On January 1 of this year, deep cuts were made in defense and other important services. Workers were furloughed. They had to take days off without pay.
				</div>
				
				<div id="para4" class="para">
				<span class="indent"></span>The most current government shutdown was also the result of fights over funding. It made a bad situation even worse. Tommy Jackson is 54. He has spent 30 years working for the government. He now works for the Air Force in Georgia. He oversees the making and placement of equipment and supplies. His wife, Debbie, also works for the government.
				</div>
				
				<div id="para5" class="para">
				<span class="indent"></span>This year, <span class="mybutton" id="b1" item="A" value="Incorrect"><span class="num">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</span> they were furloughed for six days each</span>. That added up to $6,000 in lost pay. Jackson said the idea of a <span id="display1">stable </span>job "is gone now" for many people in government. <span class="mybutton" id="b2" item="B" value="Correct"><span class="num">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</span> The days of that steady paycheck and good benefits has definitely disappeared</span>. <div></div><span class="mybutton" id="b3" item="C" value="Incorrect"><span class="num">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</span> Workers can no longer count on government positions</span>. Jackson and his wife are looking at options in private business. The furlough days "cost us a good bit of money," he said. And during the shutdown, they did not know how long they would be out. It could have been a week or two months. "I don't want to operate that way," he said.
				</div>
				
				<div id="para6" class="para">
				<span class="indent"></span>He is not alone. Lawmakers might pass a bill that gives back the pay workers lost during the shutdown. But serving the country did not use to be this uncertain. Even in bad economic times, Uncle Sam didn't go broke or close down. But federal workers have now had their pay "frozen," without raises, for three years. Congress may ask them to put more of their own money toward retirement. Some people call federal workers lazy and say their work is not important. However, they will have to stop working at some point just like everyone else in the workforce.  
				</div>
				
				<div id="para7" class="para">
				<span class="indent"></span>Without government support, it may be difficult to put enough of their own money towards the future. That "certainly doesn't help your morale," said Rick Swenson. The confidence and enthusiasm of government workers has been shaken by the shutdown. Swenson retired last year after 38 years in the U.S. Agriculture Department. He is only 60. But he was worried his benefits would be cut. And he was tired of critics.
				</div>
				
				<div id="para8" class="para">
				<span class="indent"></span>Others are following him. Retirement claims are up 30 percent over last year. Workers are cashing in on what they are owed. A federal workers' group said that creates a "brain drain." The government loses people who know how to do everything from securing borders to curing diseases, it said. Jackson said the recent crises will make it harder for the government to compete for the best and brightest minds."I knew I wasn't going to get rich doing this," he said of his job. "But I felt strongly that this was something I wanted to do.
